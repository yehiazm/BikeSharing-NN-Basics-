# BikeSharing-NN-Basics-
This repository contains my solution for the first project of Deep Learning Nanodegree introduced by Udacity. https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101
The project aims to Neural Networks basics, Implementation of Multilayer Neural Networks from scratch using NumPy and basic python code. This includes both the feedforward and backpropagation of the network. 
The network then used to estimate the number of bike riders given the ..... Using the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
